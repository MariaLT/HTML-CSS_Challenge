            <h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
            <p>
                Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of
                browser-specific tags, incompatible <u class="pointsSub">DOM</u>s, broken
                <u class="pointsSub">CSS</u> support, and abandoned browsers.
            </p>
            <p>
                We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks
                to the tireless efforts of folk like the <u class="pointsSub">W3D</u>,
                <u class="pointsSub">WaSP</u>, and the major browser creators.
            </p>
            <p>
                The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of
                the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored
                techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.

            <h3>So What is This About?</h3>
            <p>
                There is a continuing need to show the power of
                <u class="pointsSub">CSS</u>. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and
                encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs
                in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this
                very page. The <u class="pointsSub">HTML</u> remains the same, the only
                thing that has changed is the external <u class="pointsSub">CSS</u> file.
                Yes, really.
            </p>
            <p>
                <u class="pointsSub">CSS</u> allows complete and total
                control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can
                be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating
                what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those
                able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have
                contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.

            <h3>Participation</h3>
            <p>
                Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this
                page, so strong <u class="pointsSub">CSS</u> skills are necessary too, but
                the example files are commented well enough that even
                <u class="pointsSub">CSS</u> novices can use them as starting points.
                Please see the <a href="url">CSS Resource Guide</a> for advanced
                tutorials and tips on working with <u class="pointsSub">CSS</u>.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML. This may
                seem daunting at first if you’ve never worked this way before, but
                follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a
                guide.
            </p>
            <p>Download the sample <a href="url">HTML</a> and <a href="url">CSS</a> to work on a copy locally. Once you have
                completed your masterpiece (and please, don’t submit half-finished
                work) upload your <u class="pointsSub">CSS</u> file to a web server under
                your control. <a href="url">Send us a link</a> to an archive of that
                file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will
                download it and place it on our server.
